# Plagiarism Report
This document details an act of blatant plagiarism by another course participant for the Full Stack Cloud Development capstone project.

## Sequence of Events

### 1. My Submission
I submitted my capstone project in the early morning (GMT+8) on 30 Nov 2021. The style of the site was almost identical to what's available on [the site now](https://chrischow.mybluemix.net/djangoapp), less some errors in loading my custom CSS file.

### 2. Grading by User
I received an email notification that my assignment was graded at 2:22 AM on 30 Nov 2021. Upon checking Coursera, I identified the grader as **Tanner Cunningham**. See the screenshots below.

### 3. Discovery of Plagiarised Content
The next day, I proceeded to review other users' submissions and found Cunningham's submission. I was appalled to see that he had copied my work and submitted it as his own. He had not even bothered to change the content or fix the styling errors.

## Investigation
The identical work could not be coincidence. Hence, I collected evidence that the work was copied. I cloned Cunningham's GitHub repository and found a massive commit to the repository shortly after my assignment was graded. At 2:51 AM, changes to five of the most essential Python scripts for the Django app and all the HTML view templates were committed.
